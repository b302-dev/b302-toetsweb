At the core of the assessment web is the vision on education. This is leading for all (design) choices made in the assessment entities.",
          "Assessments are all (learning) activities/measuring instruments that are used to determine whether the intended learning outcomes are or have been achieved. Assessment tasks are the items or assignments within an assessment that challenge students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills. The assessment programme focuses on the clear connection between all assessments and the intended learning outcomes. The assessment programme must consist of a deliberate and substantiated combination of assessment (forms) that fit the objectives and structure of a programme (the educational programme).",
          "All substantive and procedural agreements are laid down in the assessment policy. There is often an assessment policy at the institutional level and an assessment policy at the degree programme level. The assessment policy pays attention to the assessment organisation. In the assessment organisation, lecturers, board of examiners, assessment committee, management and support staff work together in a targeted and role-based manner to achieve the desired assessment quality on all assessment entities. The assessment entity assessment literacy considers the specific expertise that all these actors – within their own role – must have in order to achieve the quality of the assessment entities.",
          "The design choices made within the entities are inextricably linked to the vision of education. The vision on assessment is part of this. By making the vision on assessment an integral part of the vision on education, it is ensured that assessment becomes part of the educational concept and that assessment literacy is experienced as part of teacher competence."

The second element, design, focuses on the question of how the development and deployment of the five assessment entities are achieved. The third element, quality assurance, focuses on the way in which the quality assurance of the assessment entities is organised.

In the web, these phases of development are symbolized as boxes. The inner ring is the activity-oriented phase, the outer ring the chain-oriented phase.

In addition, in the activity-oriented phase, assessment (tasks) are often developed just before the assessment is taken. The risk of this is that the assessment agency may receive assessments too late, causing them to experience unnecessary pressure when making and distributing the assessments. Due to the late development, it is also possible that there is carelessness in the assessment because there was no time left to look at the assessment with at least 2 teachers.

As a result, the roles, tasks and responsibilities are appropriate to the function of the actors and to their role within the degree programme, there is no unnecessary double hatting and everyone knows who can be held accountable and questioned for what. As a result, the responsibilities of the various committees (such as the assessment committee, board of examiners, curriculum committee, etc.) are also well aligned.",

This makes it clear to all involved exactly which processes may influence each other. For example: if a lecturer wants to change an assessment method, he or she knows who is responsible for the development of the assessment programme, for the assessment policy, and for the assessment literacy, and he or she checks whether the alternative assessment method is appropriate within the vision on assessment (policy) and its translation into the assessment programme, and whether the necessary assessment literacy to be able to give substance to this assessment method is present.",

Survey both staff and students regularly, so that there is also insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the various assessment processes. It is then known what is going well, but also where the points for improvement are. Make sure that the employees who carry out the evaluation know which criteria the assessment organisation must meet, and evaluate them structurally. It is good if colleagues, on the basis of evaluations, but also in daily processes, address each other about the way in which they interpret their tasks, roles and responsibilities."
